    <h2>Ratios</h2>
</summary>

<i>    Ratios serve to provide a quantitative comparison between two relevant financial metrics. They offer insights into various aspects of financial health, such as debt management, savings efficiency, affordability, and progress towards financial goals.</i>



<details style = "margin-top:10px;">
    <p><u>Debt to Income:</u> <span id="DEBTTOINCOME"></span></p>
    <i>Total debt as a percentage of income. Use: Evaluate borrowing capacity, financial health.

         Debt to Income Ratio (DTI)
Bad: Above 0.43 (43%)
Indicates a high level of debt relative to income, potentially leading to financial strain.
Okay: 0.36 to 0.43 (36% to 43%)
This range shows a manageable debt load but might limit borrowing capacity or financial flexibility.
Great: Below 0.36 (36%)
Suggests good control over debt, more income available for savings or investments, and generally better financial health.
    </i>

    <p><u>Savings to Debt:</u> <span id="SAVINGSTODEBT"></span></p>
    <i>Savings as a percentage of debt. Use: Assess financial security, emergency fund sufficiency.
    Bad Level:
Ratio: Less than 0.25:1 (Less than 25%)
Interpretation: If for every dollar of debt you have less than 25 cents in savings, your financial security is at risk. This indicates a very low capacity to handle unexpected expenses or debt repayment without potentially incurring more debt.

Okay Level:
Ratio: 0.25:1 to 0.49:1 (25% to 49%)
Interpretation: This range suggests some level of financial buffer, but it's still on the lower side. You might manage small emergencies but would struggle with significant financial shocks or debt repayment.

Great Level:
Ratio: 1:1 or higher (100% or more)
Interpretation: Having at least as much in savings as you have in debt is considered very good. This level of savings indicates you're well-prepared for emergencies, debt management, or even some financial planning for the future.

Your Case:
Ratio: 12.641 (or 1264.1%)
Interpretation: Your savings to debt ratio is significantly above the "Great" level. You are in an extremely strong financial position, with savings that greatly exceed your debt. This provides you with substantial financial security and flexibility.
    </i>


     
    <p><u>Housing to Income:</u> <span id="HOUSINGTOINCOME"></span></p>
    <i>Housing costs as a percentage of income. Use: Assess housing affordability, financial stress.
    Bad Level:
Ratio: 35% or higher
Interpretation: Spending more than 35% of your gross income on housing (mortgage or rent, plus utilities, taxes, etc.) is generally considered unsustainable. It can indicate financial strain, making it difficult to save, invest, or even cover other essential expenses.

Okay Level:
Ratio: 30% to 34.99%
Interpretation: This range aligns with the common guideline that housing costs should not exceed 30% of your gross income. While it's within the traditional affordability limit, it might still leave less room for savings or discretionary spending, particularly in high-cost areas or if other debts exist.

Great Level:
Ratio: Less than 30%
Interpretation: Keeping housing costs under 30% of your gross income is often seen as a sign of financial health. This level allows for better management of other expenses, savings, and investments, providing a comfortable lifestyle without financial pressure.

    <p><u>FIRE:</u> <span id="FIRERATIO"></span></p>
    <i>Financial Independence, Retire Early ratio; expenses covered by passive income. Use: Gauge progress towards financial independence, retirement planning.</i>


</details>
     
   <h2>Financial Projections</h2>
   
   <p><u>Revolving Debt - Time to Pay:</u> <span id="TIMETOPAYDEBT"></span></p>
<p>Revolving debt, such as student loans, lines of credit, credit cards, and tax arrears, allows for lump sum payments but usually incurs higher interest rates. This calculation estimates the time it will take to pay off the debt using disposable income if no savings are available.</p>
