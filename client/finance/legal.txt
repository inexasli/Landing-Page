**Introduction:**
This document outlines the terms of service for the use of the IEAL™ report (referred to collectively as the “IEAL™”) provided by INEXASLI (hereinafter referred to as the “Developer”). By using IEAL™, you agree to be bound by these terms of service. The term ‘user’ refers to you, the reader, when accessing IEAL™. If you do not agree with these terms, you must not use IEAL™.

**IEAL™ Purpose:**
Educational Tool for Financial Literacy:

IEAL™ is primarily intended to serve as an educational platform designed to enhance your understanding of personal finance. Through:

Interactive Learning: Users engage with financial concepts by inputting real-life data, thereby gaining a practical understanding of how income, expenses, assets, and liabilities impact financial health.

Visual and Analytical Insights: The tool provides visual representations and analyses of your financial data, which serve as educational aids to demonstrate financial principles in action.

Personal Record Keeping:

Track Financial Metrics: IEAL™ allows users to keep a personal record of their financial transactions, which aids in:
-Monitoring income and expenses.
-Cataloging assets and liabilities.
-Observing changes in financial status over time.

No Professional Advice: While IEAL™ calculates various financial metrics based on user input, these calculations are for educational purposes only. They are not intended to be relied upon for making financial decisions. Here's how to interpret the results: Estimates, Not Advice: All figures generated by IEAL™ are estimates and should be viewed as educational examples rather than personalized financial advice.

For Learning, Not Decision-Making: Use these results to understand how financial calculations work and to experiment with 'what if' scenarios. Users should seek independent advice from qualified professionals for specific financial matters.

**IEAL™ Accuracy of Results:**
The calculations provided by IEAL™ are educational estimates and are meant to offer a general understanding of financial concepts. While the developer endeavors for accuracy, they cannot guarantee precise results. Users should not rely on the results generated by IEAL™ for making financial decisions and should consult with a professional financial advisor, accountant, and/or tax authority. Please note that our frequency selector dropdown for expenses and income operates on a weekly basis, with 52 weeks constituting a year.
